# LDS Scriptures

This repo includes both the ascii text of the scriptures Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and a sqlite3 database of the same. The database makes it easy to create queries to find scriptures with particular words or phrases.

The ascii files were originally produced at this website [Iron Rod ASCII Scriptures](http://ldsguy.tripod.com/Iron-rod/). He includes a history of how the ascii files were originally obtained and produced [here](http://ldsguy.tripod.com/Iron-rod/00.Readme.html).

I wanted a way to query the scriptures so that I could include or exclude certain books, include and exclude certain phrases. A database was the answer to do these things quickly.
