# Scriptures

## Scriptures as a sqlite database

This page has a link to view the scripture passages used in the standard works of the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org) as a database.

The ascii files were originally produced by [Iron Rod ASCII Scriptures](http://ldsguy.tripod.com/Iron-rod/). The author includes a history of how the ascii files were originally obtained and produced [here](http://ldsguy.tripod.com/Iron-rod/00.Readme.html). To reiterate, the text is not from official sources.

To view the database online, I use [this sqlite viewer](http://inloop.github.io/sqlite-viewer) backed by [this source code](https://github.com/inloop/sqlite-viewer). You just need to point the url to the database stored in this repo with
